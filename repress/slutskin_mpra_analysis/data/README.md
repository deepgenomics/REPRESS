This repository includes a small subset (100 shuffled rows) of a dataset described in the following publication:

> Vainberg Slutskin, I., Weingarten-Gabbay, S., Nir, R. *et al.*  
> **Unraveling the determinants of microRNA mediated regulation using a massively parallel reporter assay**.  
> *Nature Communications* **9**, 529 (2018). [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-02980-z](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-02980-z)

We obtained the full dataset directly from the corresponding author via email correspondence, and include here only a shuffled subset (100 rows) for demonstration and testing purposes.
